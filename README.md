# common-algorithms-implementation
This is a repo that I do to let me remember how to implement algorithms. I will be using Java first, then C++ or even C, Javascript at last possibly.

## Important Algorithms

### Linked List

<p>Linked list is an easy one to start off of. Especially when using Java, there's no pointers or anything else to worry about. I don't know how I would use JS to implement since it's harder to implement class or struct, but I will get there eventually.</p>

#### Find, Insertion, and Deletion

<p>Be careful about Deletion, remember how Linus Torvalds mentioned the "correct" way to delete a node in C++, try to do that for insertion as well.</p>

### Trees

<p>Fairly similar to Linked List, but a little bit trickier. Implement the same find(), insert(), and delete(). Sorting is more complicated since it's a tree.</p>

#### Sorting

<p>For sorting, I will implement all the common/popular sorting algorithms out there.<br>Things like: insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, heapsort, quicksort, bubble sort, bucket sort, and radix sort. <br><b>Remember to have their complexity calculated.</b></p>

### Other Interesting Algorithms

#### Finding Substring (Implement contains() function)

<p>I tried to implement this once, but didn't turn out very well. Welp, time to learn. (Rabin-Karp seems like a good way to do this.)</p>

#### bool isPrime()

<p>This seems not too bad but kind of useful.</p>

<hr>
I will add more to this list once I can think of more.
